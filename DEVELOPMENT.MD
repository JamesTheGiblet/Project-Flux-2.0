üó∫Ô∏è Project Flux 2.0: Development Roadmap
Mission Statement

To evolve Project Flux 2.0 from a stable, modular engine into a complete, self-sustaining creator ecosystem. This roadmap outlines the key milestones to achieve our vision of "The System is the Game," focusing on gameplay innovation, strategic depth, and community empowerment.
Milestone 1: The Core Gameplay Loop (Target: Q4 2025)

Objective: To implement the foundational "hacking as gameplay" features. This milestone is focused on creating a playable alpha that demonstrates the core, innovative mechanics of Flux 2.0.

    1.1: Full Game Engine Integration

        Task: Integrate the actual game simulation logic (engine.js) with the main.js UI controller. This includes player movement, collision detection, scoring, and the complete game state (main menu, game over, etc.).

        Rationale: The current system has a robust UI controller but lacks the underlying game. This is the final step in unifying the application architecture.

        Status: Not Started

    1.2: Implement "Mods as Loot" System

        Task: Define codeFragment as a new, collectible drop type. Modify enemy death logic to spawn these fragments alongside power-ups.

        Rationale: This is the primary resource generation mechanic for the core loop.

        Status: Not Started

    1.3: Develop the "JIT Compiler" UI & Logic

        Task: Design and implement the in-game UI element for the Just-In-Time Compiler. This will include slots for collected fragments and a button to "compile" the temporary mod.

        Task: Write the main.js logic to stitch fragments together, send them to the mod-sandbox.js for validation, and apply the resulting temporary mod to the player for a limited duration.

        Rationale: This is the central, most innovative gameplay feature of Flux 2.0. Its successful implementation is critical.

        Status: Not Started

    1.4: First Playable Alpha Release

        Task: Package and release a playable alpha version that includes all features from this milestone.

        Rationale: To gather initial feedback on the core gameplay loop and identify major issues early.

        Status: Not Started

Deliverable for M1: A playable game where users can fight enemies, collect code fragments, and use the JIT Compiler to create temporary, chaotic mods during gameplay.
Milestone 2: The Strategic & Environmental Layer (Target: Q1 2026)

Objective: To build upon the core loop by adding layers of strategic depth and replayability. This phase transforms the alpha from a simple arcade experience into a game with meaningful choices.

    2.1: Implement the "Mod Deck Builder"

        Task: Create a new pre-game screen where players can browse their saved mods and choose a limited "loadout" (e.g., 1 weapon, 1 rule) to bring into a run.

        Rationale: Introduces strategic planning and makes a user's collection of custom mods a valuable asset.

        Status: Not Started

    2.2: Architect the Environment System

        Task: Create a new environment-system.js and add environment as a discoverable category in the mod-loader.js.

        Rationale: Expands the modularity of the engine to the battlefield itself, creating a major new content category for modders.

        Status: Not Started

    2.3: Create a Starter Environment Mod Pack

        Task: Develop a flux-environments-pack with at least three distinct environment mods (e.g., zero-gravity.js, asteroid-field.js, corrosive-fog.js).

        Rationale: To prove and showcase the capabilities of the new Environment System.

        Status: Not Started

    2.4: Beta Release & Gameplay Balancing

        Task: Release a beta version incorporating all M1 and M2 features. Begin balancing difficulty, drop rates, and mod interactions based on player feedback.

        Rationale: To refine the complete gameplay experience before focusing on community features.

        Status: Not Started

Deliverable for M2: A feature-complete beta with high replayability, strategic loadouts, and dynamic, moddable environments.
Milestone 3: The Community & Content Platform (Target: Q2 2026)

Objective: To launch Flux 2.0 as a true, self-sustaining platform for user-generated content, fulfilling the final pillar of the Praximous vision.

    3.1: Develop the "Black Market" Mod Browser

        Task: Design and implement an in-game UI for browsing, searching, and "installing" community mods.

        Task: This UI will use the Import from String functionality as its core mechanic.

        Rationale: Lowers the barrier to entry for using community content to near-zero, fostering a vibrant ecosystem.

        Status: Not Started

    3.2: Establish a Community Mod Database

        Task: Set up a simple, centralized repository (e.g., a dedicated GitHub repository acting as a database) to host shareable mod strings submitted by the community. The Black Market UI will fetch its listings from this source.

        Rationale: Provides a central, trusted source for community content without requiring complex backend infrastructure.

        Status: Not Started

    3.3: Community Launch Event: "The First Forge"

        Task: Organize and promote a launch event or contest to encourage creators to build and submit the first wave of mods for the Black Market.

        Rationale: To bootstrap the community ecosystem and generate excitement for the 1.0 release.

        Status: Not Started

    3.4: Official 1.0 Release

        Task: Polish all features, fix critical bugs, and officially launch Project Flux 2.0.

        Rationale: The culmination of all development efforts.

        Status: Not Started

Deliverable for M3: The official launch of Flux 2.0 as a complete game and a thriving, community-driven modding platform.
